# Exercises

All exercises use the dvdstore database. DALs are already created, except for the Customer Search, where you'll fill in the data access methods.

## Actor Search

Given a search string, display all the actors whose `last_name` contains that search string. The display should show `first_name` and `last_name`.

## Customer Search

Given a name search and a sort order, display all customers whose `first_name` or `last_name` match the search in the order specified. The sort order could be by `last_name`, `email`, or `active`. You need to make DALs for this exercise.
